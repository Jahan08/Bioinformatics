GlycoSHIELD is a simple MD pipeline to generate glycoprotein models. "Glycan shields" refers to the protective structures formed by complex sugars attached to proteins through glycosylation. These shields are dynamic and cover a significant portion of the protein surface, impacting protein conformation and surface accessibility. Computational methods like GlycoSHIELD can model these glycan structures efficiently, providing insights into their morphology and impact on protein structure.
